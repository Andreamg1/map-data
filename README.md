# PYTHON API FOR VIEWING MONGODB CLUSTER

Intended for use in a school project, but if you also have a
mongoDB database with similar structure, this can work for you.

## FIND ONE OR FIND ALL

Find one document with a specific name/searchTerms field,
or just get all the documents in a collection.
Getting an entire collection DOESN'T need similar data structure.

## INSTALLATION
1. Set up environment
>   python -m venv *your venv name*
- Download requirements
>   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run with uvicorn
- Get data???
